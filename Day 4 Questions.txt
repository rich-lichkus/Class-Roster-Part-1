Roster App Day 4

1. I NSLogged from the viewDidLoad and the viewWillAppear. The print order is the order they execute.

2. The four values are (x,y,width,height). The x,y is the position of the origin relative to its superclass view. The last two are the width and height of the rectangle.

3. removeFromSuperview - this will remove a subview from its superclass.

4. The frame is the size and position of the view in its superclass. Whereas the bounds set the origin and size for its subclass views.
